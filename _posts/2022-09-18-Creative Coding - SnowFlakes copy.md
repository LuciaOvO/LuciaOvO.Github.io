# ðŸŒŸ Concept ðŸŒŸ
Since I haven't learned enough about Class, I learned a little bit about creating a snow scene using Class on Youtube. And for this part of the concept may use the learned particle motion to create a background. I think snowflakes are good for backgrounds and I personally like snow, although I made it look less realistic.

Then I made two attempts, one with snowflakes and another idea with particle motion, they are more like floating cells, living cells. Here are the two different particle motions I made.

# ðŸŒŸ Concept ðŸŒŸ
This is a small exercise of interaction with mouse movement, and I may improve this interaction slightly to implement in the final idea. But in terms of color and form I will improve it according to the final idea. Right now it looks a little boring, but it has a bubbly feel to it.

The second interactive exercise also uses mouse clicks to generate bubbles, which is more interactive than mouse movement.

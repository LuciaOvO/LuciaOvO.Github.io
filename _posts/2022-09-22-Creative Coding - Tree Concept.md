# ðŸŒŸ Concept ðŸŒŸ
Based on the principles of the tree in my teacher's tutorial, I came across a tree instruction online that I wanted to put into the concept of my AT2 assignment. Using recursive functions to make random tree branches, it is particularly convenient to run your own way to achieve this without writing out duplicate code, as well as using the ```beginShape()``` and ```endShape()``` methods to make the leaves of the tree. It's a great learning process.

The second one is a 3D version of the tree made in a similar way, and the principle is basically the same. However, the ```randomSeed()``` method is used to make the random values consistent.

# ðŸŒŸ Concept ðŸŒŸ
According to research studies cats are naturally inclined to catch things that move because their dynamic vision is about four times greater than that of humans. It is difficult to explain because there is no unit to compare dynamic vision as a numerical value, but it is said that cats can detect even a movement of 4 mm per second. So I wanted to make a bouncing ball as a concept idea for AT3.
And according to the research, the colors that cats can see are purple, blue, green, and yellow. So the little ball is yellow.

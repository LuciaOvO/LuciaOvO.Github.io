# ðŸŒŸ Concept ðŸŒŸ
This is another concept that makes a fish and has a tail that moves because the cat's eyesight can catch any subtle changes. The interesting point of this idea is that it allows better interaction with cats and more flexibility. Because the fish is controlled by the mouse. And the color used is also within the range of the cat's visual color.

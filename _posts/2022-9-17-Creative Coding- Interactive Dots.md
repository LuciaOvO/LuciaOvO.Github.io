# ðŸŒŸ Concept ðŸŒŸ 
This is an interactive exercise using Javascript, based on the 2D array tutorial in the YouTube video, thus extending an idea to incorporate a bit of simple interactive effects. You can try long presses on the screen to achieve interactive effects.
I thought it was an interesting interaction because this time the theme I wanted to focus on particles, so I did it all about particles.
